//1.
//We plan on storing the polynomials using linked lists. 


//3.pseudo code for functions
//create/delete a polynomial
//
// add/subtract two polynomials


//multiplication/division by a double
//normalise polynomial (coefficient of highest order term = 1)
//return order of polynomial (the highest power with coefficient 6= 0)
//print polynomial
